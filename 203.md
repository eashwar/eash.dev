# Jan 9th: Propositional Equivalencies and Logic Puzzles

### Logic Puzzle 1

You ask Alice what she is, but can't hear her. You ask Bob what Alice said.

| **Alice** | **Bob** | **Carol** |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| TT        | TT      | TT        |
| TT        | TT      | L         |
| TT        | L       | TT        |
| TT        | L       | L         |
| L         | TT      | TT        |
| L         | TT      | L         |
| L         | L       | TT        |
| L         | L       | L         |

Bob says "Alice said she is a liar".

Alice would have said she was a truthteller regardless of who she is, so Bob must be a liar.

| **Alice** | **Bob** | **Carol** |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| TT        | L       | TT        |
| TT        | L       | L         |
| L         | L       | TT        |
| L         | L       | L         |

Then Carol says that Bob is a liar. We corroborate her story, meaning Carol is a truthteller.

| **Alice** | **Bob** | **Carol** |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| TT        | L       | TT        |
| L         | L       | TT        |

Finally, Carol states that Alice is a liar. We know that Carol tells the truth, so we have our answer.

| **Alice** | **Bob** | **Carol** |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| L         | L       | TT        |

### Logic Puzzle 2

You arrive at a pair of gates - one leading to paradise, one leading to death. In front of the gates is one liar and one truthteller. Asking only one question, can you know which gate is the correct one?



Ask what the other one would say.



### Logic Puzzle 3

On a new island, people lie on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.



## Translating English into Logic

* You can major in CSE only if you pass EECS 203.

*p = You can major in CSE,   q = you pass EECS 203*

$p \to q$

* You cannot major in CSE unless you pass EECS 203.

$\neg q$ $\to$ $\neg p$

* Have your iClicker whenever you attend class.

*p = have your iClicker,   q = you attend class*

$q \to p$ is correct. $\neg p \to \neg q$ is called the **contrapositive** and is also true.



**Tautologies** are propositions that are **always true**. Example: $\neg p \lor p$
**Contradictions** are propositions that are **always false** Example: $\neg p \land p$

Two compound propositions $p$ and $q$ are **logically equivalent** if and only if they have the same truth table, i.e. $p \leftrightarrow q$ is a tautology.

### Proving Logical Equivalence

1. If my nose is cold then I am unhappy.
2. If I'm happy then my nose isn't cold.
3. My nose is not cold or I'm unhappy.

*p = my nose is cold,   q = I am unhappy*

| $p$  | $q$  | $p \to q$ | $\neg q \to \neg p$ | $\neg p \lor q$ |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| T    | T    | T         | T                   | T               |
| T    | F    | F         | F                   | F               |
| F    | T    | T         | T                   | T               |
| F    | F    | T         | T                   | T               |

#### De Morgan's Laws (negating 'and' and 'or')

* $\neg (p \land q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q$
* $\neg (p \lor q) \equiv \neg p \land \neg q$

# Jan 11th: Relational (First-Order) Logic

* In _**propositional logic**_:
    * All we have are propositions and connectives, making compound propositions.
    * We learn about deductions and proofs based on the structure of the propositions.

* In _**first-order logic**_,
    * We will add objects, properties, and relations.
    * We will be able to make statements about what is true for some, all, or no objects.

## Objects and Relations

* "Dan is taller than both his mothers, but they're the same height."
    * If we want to use only propositional logic, we need to define 4 propositions:
        * p = Dan is taller than Mother 1.
        * q = Dan is taller than Mother 2.
        * r = Mother 1 is taller than Mother 2.
        * s = Mother 2 is taller than Mother 2.
    * This becomes $p \land q \land \neg r \land \neg s$

There's ***nothing*** in these statements to show that they're all essentially the same statement with the people replaced. There's no ability for abstraction.

Predicate logic explicitly describes **objects**.

* Let's create *Dan*, *M1*, and *M2*.

And **relations** among objects: $T(x,y)=$ "$x$ $is$ $taller$ $than$ $y$"

We can now say: $T(Dan,M1) \land T(Dan,M2) \land \neg T(M1,M2) \land \neg T(M2,M1)$.

## Single-Argument Relations

* A relation can have just a single arg.
    * "*If you're happy, I'm happy.*"
        * Let $H(x)$ = "x is happy."
        * $H(you) \to H(I)$

* A more complex example:
    * *"If rain is forecast for Wednesday I'll buy an umbrella, otherwise I'll buy a latte."*
    *$R(x) =$ "Rain is forecast for $x$."
    *$B(x, y) =$ "$x$ will buy a $y$."
    * $(R(Wed) \to B(me, umbrella)) \land (\neg R(Wed) \to B(me, latte))$

## Predicates and Quantification

* How do we write *"<u>Everyone</u> will buy an umbrella."

* $B(Aaron, umbrella) \land B(Abner, umbrella)$ ad infinitum.

* Problems:
    * maybe an *infinite* number of things to list
        * In some cases, uncountable infinities.
    * Not sure who's in the list.


### We can use the Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)! ("for all", "every")

$\forall x$ $B(x,umbrella)$ is "Everyone will buy an umbrella."

### There's also the EXISTENTIAL QUANTIFIER ($\exists$). ("there exists", "at least one", "some")

$\exists x$ $B(x,umbrella)$ is "Someone will buy an umbrella."


When we say $\forall$ we need to define our "domain of discourse" or "universe of discourse".

* It defines the "universe" of all possible $x$ in "$\forall x$ $P(x)$
    * Strictly speaking, $x$ can be **anythiing**.
    * By explicitly specifying our domain, we can focus on one "type" (in the umbrella case, people would be a good domain of discourse).


## Translating English $\to$ Quantifications

* "everyone will buy an umbrella or a raincoat"

    * $\forall x$ $(B(x,umbrella) \lor B(x, raincoat))$

* "everyone will buy an umbrella or everyone will buy a raincoat"

    * $\forall x$ $B(x,umbrella) \lor \forall y$ $B(y, raincoat)$
        * To reduce confusion of a variable's scope, use different variables when changing scopes.

* "no one will buy both a raincoat and umbrella"
    * $\neg \exists x$ $(B(x,umbrella) \land B(x,raincoat))$

* "everyone has a car or knows someone with a car."
    * Let $C(x) =$ "$x$ has a car"
    * Let $K(x, y) =$ "$x$ knows $y$"

    $\forall x$ $\exists y$ $[C(x) \lor (K(x,y) \land C(y))]$

## Quantifications to English

$$\exists x \forall y \forall z[(y \neq z \land K(x,y) \land K(x,z)) \to \neg K(y,z)], where K(x,y) = "x\space knows \space y"$$

"Someone knows a group of people where each pair of people do not know each other."

## Logical Equivalencies ($\equiv$)

Two statements that are always the same.

For example:

$$\neg\forall x$ $P(x) \equiv\exists x$ $\neg P(x)$$
* There is an x for which $P(x)$ is false.


$$\neg\exists x$ $P(x) \equiv \forall x \neg P(x)$$
* For every x, $P(x)$ is false.

### more translations
* Every two people have a freind in common.
Let $F(x,y) = x$is a friend with$y$.
$\forall x \forall y \exists z [x \neq y \to (F(x,z) \land F(y,z)]$

* "There is a person in this class all of whose friends in this class will get As"
$C(x)$: "$x$ is in this class"
$F(x,y)$: "$x$ and $y$ are friends"
$A(x)$: "$x$ will get an A"

$\exists x \forall y C(x) \land [F(x,y) ^ C(y) \to A(y)]$
$\exists x \forall y C(x) \land [F(x,y) \to(C(y) \to A(y))]$
Both of these statements are correct translations.

# Jan 16th: Introduction to Proofs
An **argument** for a statement S is a sequence of statements ending with S.
We call S the **conclusion** and all the other statements the **premises**.
The argument is **valid** if whenever all of the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
**Proofs** are **valid arguments** that establish the truth of mathematical statements.

## Introduction Rules

# Jan 18th: Proof Methods and Strategy
### Inferences Involving Quantifiers
* $P(c)$ allows us to infer that $\therefore\exists x P(x)$
* $\forall x P(x)$ allows us to infer that $\therefore P(c)$
* If we state $\exists x P(x)$ we can write a box saying (Let $c P(c)$. ---> $q$). If we can arrive at the proposition $q$ in the box, we can conclude $\therefore q$ outside of the box too.
* Finally; if within a box we start with ($c$ and then reach the conclusion that $P(c)$) we can say $\therefore\forall x P(x)$

### example

1. $\forall x (B(x) \to A(x))$ (premise i)
2. $\exists x B(x)$ (premise 2)
(start box)
3. $c B(c)$ (assumption, c is a specific person)
4. $B(c) \to A(c)$ ($\forall$-elim, 1)
5. $A(c)$ ($\to$-elim, 3,4)
6. $\exists x A(x)$ ($\exists$-intro, 5)
(close box)
7. $\exists x A(x)$ ($\exists$-elim, 2,3-6) (**CONCLUSION**)

### inference example
1. $\forall x \forall y(P(x)\to Q(y))$ (premise)
2. $\exists x P(x)$ (premise)
(open box)
3. $y_0$
(open box)
4. $x_0 P(x_0)$ (assumption)
5. $\forall y P(x_0)\to Q(y)$ ($\forall$-elim 1, $x_0$)
6. $P(x_0)\to Q(y_0)$ ($\forall$-elim 5,$y_0$)
7. $Q(y_0)$ ($\to$-elim 6,4)
(close box)
8. $Q(y_0)$ ($\exists$-elim 2,4-7)
(close box)
9. $\forall y Q(y)$ ($\forall$-intro 3-8) (**CONCLUSION**)

### proof by contradiction
**<u>Claim:</u>** There ar einfinitely many prime numbers.
**<u>Proof (by contradiction:</u>**
1. Assume the claim is <u>*false*</u>.
2. List all primes in increasing order: $p_1,p_2,p_n$
3. Define $K = (p_1p_2p_3...p_i...p_n)+1$
4. For every $p_i,p_i$ $K$ does not divide evenly.
5. Hence $K$ is prime.
6. $(p_n \text{is the largest prime})\land(K\text{is prime})\land(K>p_n)\equiv F$
7. Hence there is no finite list of primes.

## Types of Proof Methods
* Proof by Contradiction
    * To show $p$ is true, assume $\neg p$ and derive a falsehood
* Proof by Construction
    * Particularly useful for existential statements: $\exists x\exists y P(x,y)$
    * Just exhibit one $x$ and one $y$ that makes $P(x,y)$ is true.
* Proof by Cases
    * Separate the possibilities into all cases.
    * Show $(\text{Case 1}\to p)\land(\text{Case 1}\to p)\land(\text{Case 1}\to p)$
    * this implies $p$ must be true.
