## [how are things?]({{page.url}})

Things are going pretty well for me, actually. I've learned so much this summer from writing this website, my Java internship, and the [running app](https://github.com/eashwar/running-calculator) I built. It's making me really excited for college to start - I can't wait to make new friends and just learn a bunch of stuff. I also have to get started on packing - there's a lot left.

I started playing Portal 2 and Mirror's Edge again, and I'm thinking about relearning the speedrun for one of them. ME any% was a lot of fun to learn before, but I've always been interested in running a Source Engine game. I also want to get better at Sm4sh, so I'm trying to pick up a few new characters (namely, Sonic and Link).

I haven't been practicing the clarinet as much as I should have been. I'll probably start back up next week to get prepped for college. I've been messing around a decent amount on the piano, though - I'm working on another project that I'll probably put on Soundcloud by the end of the month.
