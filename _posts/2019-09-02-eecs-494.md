## [EECS 494]({{page.url}})

During the fall 2019 semester at the University of Michigan, I'm taking EECS 494: Game Development. During the semester, as I complete projects for the course, I will post links to my work here.

### **Project 1: Metroid (NES) Recreation**

For our first project, we were tasked with recreating the beginning parts of Brinstar, the first area of Metroid for the NES, in Unity. We recreated gameplay behavior as well as the various enemies featured in the map. Additionally we had to create a custom mechanic/powerup for Samus, and design a custom Metroid map that showcased the use of this powerup. The mechanic that our team came up with was a gliding mechanic; Samus can press the jump button while in midair to glide gently across large gaps. A link to download the game is below!
