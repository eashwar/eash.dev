## [Chiptune Contrapunctus VII]({{page.url}})

As part of my application to the University of Michigan's Sound Engineering program, I had to make a cover of a JS Bach Fugue. I picked the Contrapunctus VII fugue, from The Art of Fugue. The piece has 4 parts: "Boot Up/Title Screen", "Overworld", "Boss Fight", and "Game Over".
