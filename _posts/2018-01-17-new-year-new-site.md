### The site looks the same, what was updated?

This website now uses Jekyll! That means that writing blog posts is no longer a pain, and I now feel good about the website. Look out for CSS updates, probably soon!


### NACVGM!
I was at the 5th Annual North American Conference for Video Game Music! It was held at the University of Michigan and I had an absolute blast meeting people and hearing some awesome talks.

[Here's](http://smtd.umich.edu/performances_events/nacvgm/documents/nacvgm-program.pdf) the program if you're interested, and check out [#nacvgm](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NACVGM) on twitter to follow up on what happened and what the people that were there are doing now.

### School
First semester is over, and second semester is under way! I'm taking 3 EECS classes ([Computing for Computer Scientists](c4cs.github.io), Intro to DSA, Discrete Mathematics), Honors Physics 2 (electromagnetism), and University Band! That's cool.

### Some Other Stuff
I got a Nintendo Switch with Xenoblade Chronicles!! That game is really pretty and has a wonderful soundtrack. I'm absolutely enjoying the gameplay, I may write a review up when I finish it fully (no rush, though).
