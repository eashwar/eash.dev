## [Video Game Music Club at the University of Michigan ]({{page.url}})

I'm one of the starting members of the Video Game Music Club at the University of Michigan! This club meets weekly to discuss various aspects of composition, technical implementation, music theory, and more as it relates to game audio. A list of topics we've discussed and the Google Slides presentations for our meetings can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t2b7p8IR2xdU7_cBaSIov0nOPkppg2VA?usp=sharing){:target="blank"}{:rel="noopener"}!
