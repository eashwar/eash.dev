## [college, pt. 1!](https://eashwar.github.io/posts/post5.html)

Hey there! College has begun and it's been two full months already. How have things been for me? Pretty good, actually!

### Clubs

I joined the [FIRST Alumni and Mentorship Network at Michigan (FAMNM, pronounced "fam")](http://famnm.club/) and that has been a whole lot of fun. I've also joined the parkour club, the quiz bowl team, and have been looking around at other clubs as well.

### Classes

Classes have been going well too! I'm in a software engineering class called "Gaming for the Greater Good", and we're developing video games that can be played by the visually impaired! The team I'm on is working on a cool 3D audio-based game. I'm also in honors mechanics, a class on underwater archaeology, and a class on video game music. Overall, I've been having a lot of fun.

### Summer internship!

I went to the University of Michigan engineering career fair this fall, and had the opportunity to interview with a few companies! I got an offer for an internship next year from TechSmith in Okemos, MI! They're really an incredible company and I'm excited to be able to work with them next summer.

### C++

Finally got around to learning `c++` which is pretty cool. I also find it really scary that you can do pointer arithmetic because you have the chance of accessing the wrong address if you mess it up.

Overall, things have been good.
