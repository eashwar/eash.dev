description: thoughts on my music project in 2025 of one track a month and self expression in art.

in my last post, i reflected on one of my two major art projects in 2025, which was to learn art from scratch by drawing daily.

the other project i mentioned was the challenge to also release one track of music a month!

now, unlike visual art, i would claim a pretty decent amount of experience as an instrumentalist, composer and producer. my credentials: as of 2026, i've been playing the piano for 20 years; the bass clarinet for 15; i started composing and doing music production 10 years ago, and in college i spent a significant amount of time studying and specializing in the field of game audio/video game music.

you can listen to my full discography of music i've made across the past 10 years on [my bandcamp](http://music.eash.dev/music)! if you want to hear some of the stuff i'm most proud of prior to this year's project, i'd suggest [endless reverie](https://music.eash.dev/album/endless-reverie) -- the jrpg-inspired soundtrack i wrote across 3 years for a jrpg-inspired d&d campaign.

## why did i decide to do this project?

i had a few motivations for starting this project:

- the past few years, all of the music projects i'd worked on had been collaborative projects with friends and colleagues: the aforementioned [d&d campaign](https://music.eash.dev/album/endless-reverie), scoring [an audio play](https://music.eash.dev/album/the-cyberrats-radio-hour-original-score) and [its sequel](https://music.eash.dev/album/cyberrats-radio-hour-episode-2-original-score), and a [game jam at work](https://music.eash.dev/album/democracy-bus-original-soundtrack). i really wanted to work on some sort of project just for myself.
- i had absolutely no idea how the daily drawing project was gonna affect my creative juices -- whether it would be motivating, or demotivating, or maybe some of both? especially given that it was a brand new artistic medium to me, i wanted to give myself structured time to create art in a medium i already felt comfortable in.
- i wanted a project that could justify me having an eclectic collection of music in random genres and styles -- and the idea of a musical time capsule with each track representing the particular month of the year took shape pretty early on.
