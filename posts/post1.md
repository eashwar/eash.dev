## [first post: learning](https://eashwar.github.io/posts/post1.html)

I'm writing this post using [`showdown`](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)!
It's a javascript library that parses markdown files and inserts them as html.

```
function test() {
 console.log("success");
}
```

I'll probably post here more often later, and probably set up an actual blogsite. Until then, this is empty!
