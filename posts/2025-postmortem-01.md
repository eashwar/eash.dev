description: Thoughts on the art challenge i completed in 2025 to draw every day.

In December of 2024, as many people are wont to do, i began to assemble my list of goals for 2025. Generally, i approach this as specifically *goal-setting* and not resolutions because i find that vague quantification of specific achievements tends to work a lot better for me. I'll spare you the full details of the list, but included among them were:

- *big life goals* (e.g. get a new job, buy a car -- both of which i did accomplish successfully, by the way!),
- *fitness and health goals* (e.g. run 1000 miles, of which i only got through 1000km instead, but not too bad),
- *artistic consumption goals* (e.g. get through 12 books, or N games in my video game backlog -- which went somewhat okay? but not amazing)

Now, that was alreadyu an ambitious and daunting list i gave to myself for 2025. i might discuss later my thoughts on the things that happened last year, but all I'll really say is that it was a very tough year and i'm proud to be on the other end of it. 

To top it all off, the final section of my list was about *artistic output goals*:

- release 1 piece of music a month
- draw something or contribute to a visual art project every day in a way that includes using a digital or physical writing implement.
  - optional: create a personal brand sheet; a self-designed logo, wordmark, and color palette.

More than i can likely fully verbalize, these last two goals both dominated more of my free time than i anticipated but also served as important emotional anchors for me throughout the year, contrasted with the large number of life changes i went through. 

I wanted to spend some time reflecting on the massive corpus of art that i amassed, and the things i learned and enjoyed about the art i created and skills i honed throughout the duration of the process. this post is a discussion of the daily drawing project. i'm still working on my reflections re: the music I made. 

## the start of it


at the start of this year, i'd say i'm what you call an extreme amateur at visual art. i had tried my hand at pixel art enough to own and use Aseprite once in a while when i play tabletop games with friends, but otherwise I'd say that since the art classes i took in elementary and middle school, i had not meaningfully developed or pursued any skill in art. why start now? what did i want out of it? i can't really tell you what exactly struck me to do it, but i realized that i'd always really wanted to be able to call myself an artist, and specifically i realized that i wanted to eventually be able to produce visual art approximately at a similar level to the way i can produce music: to be able to take something in my mind's eye and produce something pretty damn close to it, enough that i think i can share it with others and they can somewhat approach an understanding of what i originally conceived internally.


the original formulation of this drawing goal was much more simply worded: "draw something every day." it evolved into the form you see above sometime in march when i got a drawing tablet and started working on some pieces of art across multiple days, since it contributed to the reason behind the goal; to get better at visual art and begin developing a personal art style.

that being said, at the beginning all i had was some notepads lying around and a few pencils. so i got cracking.

from day 1 i chose that the way i'll hold myself externally accountable to this goal was to post on public social media and share the link with my friends. i chose bluesky for this as it's the one i was happening to try to navigate at the end of 2024. but even after i definitely knew that the habit had cemented itself quite well, i kept the bsky posting as a way to publicly document the progress i made and have proof that i did accomplish this.

i started the way many of your favorite online artists might: with some fanart. i painstakingly spent 75 minutes on the above day 1 drawing, carefully line-by-line copying off of a screenshot of the game Zenless Zone Zero. You can see how scratchy these lines are; how they seem all discrete and independent from each other rather than being a combination of lines intentionally representing a form; flat and messy; and on very small paper.

and hey, it doesn't actually look half bad! it looks relatively close to the source, at least! but the time it took was kinda abysmal, and it really didn't feel like "real drawing" as much as just copying (oh, little did i realize at this point how much learning art is studying art you like)

within a few days, i realized a few things; i needed to learn about shapes, i needed to be paying better attention to my surroundings, and i needed to have bigger paper to draw on.
