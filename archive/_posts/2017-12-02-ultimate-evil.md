I had the opportunity to take the University of Michigan's Video Game Music course in Fall 2017. The class's final project had us composing a piece that would fit in a video game. I took inspiration from the Mario & Luigi RPG Series, whose soundtracks were composed by Yoko Shimomura, to write a boss battle theme for a character I call "the Ultimate Evil".
