# Contributing

If you want to make improvements to my website, for some odd reason, first make an Issue for it so I know what you're doing, then make a branch titled `feature/{your feature}`. I'll personally approve your PR if I want to accept your changes. Email me at `contributing@eash.fyi` if you've got questions.
