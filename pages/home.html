        <h2>New Music!!!</h2>
        <p>I recently released two new albums! Please take a look:</p>
        <p>First, we have the music I wrote for the three-year long D&D campaign I played in with my friends. We just wrapped up the adventure a few weeks ago so I combined all the music I wrote and released it as an album! This work really encomapsses how much I've grown in the past three years. Enjoy!</p>
