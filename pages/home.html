        <h1>Robot Rescue (Original Game Soundtrack)</h1>
        <p>
            At the Global Game Jam 2020 (back in January), I was on a two-person team and helped work on the isometric shooter Robot Rescue (which placed second at the Ann Arbor site!) Here's the soundtrack to the game, all songs composed from scratch in 48 hours.
